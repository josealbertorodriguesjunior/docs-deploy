Peer Quick Start
================
The easiest and quickest way to get a Subutai Peer running on any
platform is to use Vagrant with VirtualBox. Don't use package managers
to install them: their versions are too old. Download the latest vagrant
2.0.1 or higher and VirtualBox 5.1.0 or higher from their respective
websites. Once Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed init the Vagrantfile
then up the instance:

(Here we need to copy requirements from current user guide on website.)

1.1 This command creates a VM based on Ubuntu Server 16.04.3.
(Recommended):

vagrant init --minimal subutai/xenial

1.2 This command creates a VM based on Debian 9.x. :

vagrant init --minimal subutai/stretch

2. After you should install special plugin for VirtualBox:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

3. When plugin is installed you need to build your peer:

vagrant up
^^^^^^^^^^

**Congratulations you have a Peer!**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| default:
| default: SUCCESS: Your peer is up. Welcome to the Horde!
| default: -----------------------------------------------
| default:
| default: Next steps ...
| default: Make sure Subutai's E2E Extension/Plugin is installed in your
  browser
| default: Search for 'Subutai' in your browser's extension/plugin store
  to find it and install.
| default:
| default: Console URL: https://172.16.1.121:8443
| default: Default u/p: 'admin' / 'secret'
| default:
| default: Vagrant ssh and change the default 'subutai'/'ubuntai' user
  password!
| default: If you forget the url, just take a look in
  .vagrant/generated.yml

After peer is created you need to register it on hub.subut.ai. Please
use given to you before credentials: IP address, login and password of
new peer (login and password always the same: admin/secret), you will be
able to change password during the registration.

1. Enter given IP address into address bar of browser.

2. Input login and password, and change the last one.

3. The Subutai Console will be opened, on the right corner of this page
       push “Register” button and input all necessary information: your
       login and password on hub.subut.ai, name of peer, peer’s scope
       (public/private). And push “register” button.

4. Your peer will appear on hub.subut.ai peers list.

You can now use it!
