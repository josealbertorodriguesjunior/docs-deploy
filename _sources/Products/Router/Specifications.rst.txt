Specifications
==============
The Blockchain Router is based on an open architecture with a FOSSH
design available at the GitHub1. It uses the most advanced MPSoC on the
market: Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ with two SODIMM DDR4 RAM slots; one for
the processing system (PS), the other for the programming logic (PL):
total capacity of 16 GB. The PL has enough logic cells and RAM to mine
Ethereum tokens while the PS functions as a plug-and-play Subutai PeerOS
Appliance and broadband router. Broadband routers are an essential
ingredient in the business of providing Internet services and the
Blockchain Router is built to remain competitive well into the future
with the prevalence of 5G and 100GB Ethernet technologies to support
Subutai's economy operators.
