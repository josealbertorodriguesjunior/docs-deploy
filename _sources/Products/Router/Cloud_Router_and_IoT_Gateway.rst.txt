Cloud Router And IoT Gateway
============================
As the way we use the Internet evolves, new functions have started
emerging in the broadband devices we use for Internet access. Dumb bare
bones router/modem devices are no longer suitable for future
applications in the Cloud and the Internet of Things. The market is
showing the emergence of powerful routers, packed with computational
resources for gaming, cloud computing, and security. The Subutai
Blockchain Router is a flexible powerhouse designed for Cloud and IoT
applications well into the future.

The router was designed to be extremely flexible, as the Swiss Army
Knife for IoT and industrial automation. It comes with a plethora of
extensions. There's an Arduino Uno header, a Raspberry Pi hat, and 4
PMod connectors for shields compatible with these hardware development
platforms. Tens of thousands of detectors, actuators, communication
devices, and peripheral connect buses can be added to the router to
interface with just about any system in the physical world. All
connectors attach directly to the PL FPGA I/Os with maximum flexibility
for designers making it the de facto standard open development and
prototyping platform for IoT and industrial automation applications.
