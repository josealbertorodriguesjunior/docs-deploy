Domains
=======
You can point domain names to your environments and containers. For now
the only available option are subdomains of 'envs.subutai.cloud', but in
the future that will be expanded. You may add your own subdomain by
clicking "Add new" and checking the availability of your desired
subdomain. After the environment is created, you need to set up a
container port mapping. See more detailed information on "How to create
and use environment" page.
