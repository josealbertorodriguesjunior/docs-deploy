Chat Notifications Balance
==========================
**Balance** - here users can check information about their current
amount of GoodWills (Subutai Bazaar's `internal
currency <https://subutai.io/goodwill.html>`__).

**Notifications** - here users can see all the recent system
notifications. You can clear them.

**Chat** - By clicking on the "Chat" button, a special window shows up
with a list of all Subutai Bazaar users, both offline and online. You
can choose a user and write them a private message. Here also you can
create conversation rooms and add to other users to them, to start a
group dialogue. On this window you can search by username. On the bottom
of the window, you can turn off or turn on sound notifications.
