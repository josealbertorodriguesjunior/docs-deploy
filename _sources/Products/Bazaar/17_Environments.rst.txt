Environments
============
An **Environment** is a logically grouped set of containers distributed
across multiple peers that share the same network (they belong to the
same p2p swarm - see more on
`p2p <https://github.com/subutai-io/p2p/>`__). An environment can host a
number of applications.

Templates

Environments are based on templates - basic software packages that
provide a set of functionalities and can be extended to whatever you may
need. For instance, there are templates that allow you to deploy a
Debian server image to a Subutai Environment. You can use the templates
already available in the PeerOS and Bazaar, or you an even create your
own:

Check how to create Templates (from the `command-line
interface <https://github.com/subutai-io/base/wiki/Create-Templates-from-CLI>`__
or the `Subutai
Console <https://github.com/subutai-io/base/wiki/Create-Templates-from-Console>`__).
